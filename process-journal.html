                <p>The aim of this project is to create a high fidelty prototype of an interface for an autonomous vehicle. As a group, we picked a specific context to focus on, and in this case we decided on tour buses and tour transport in general. During the process, we have conducted user testing, prototyping and evaluation to create an interface and interaction experience most suited to our context.</p>

                <p>In <b>week 1</b> of the semester, we began the design process by forming our groups and discussing initial ideas and problem areas. This involved filling out a group charter, defining our goals, general guidelines and discussing initial roles or focus areas for each member of our group going forward.</p>
                  
                <p>Having received the design brief, we knew that we would be designing a user interface for some form of autonomous vehicle. With this in mind, we began ideating more specific contexts to address with our design. We did this by creating mind maps and lists with our ideas, then expanding on them to see where we might be able to take them and whether it would be an interesting area to focus on. Some of the initial areas we were interested in included school buses, tour buses, party/amusement buses.</p>

                <p>To further investigate the different areas we were interested in and explore what they might have to offer, we each did some background research which we collated in a google docs. This revealed that there were already autonomous school buses in development, but nothing in the tour bus industry. This meant that we had more freedom to design the interface around hypothetical features that might be implemented in the future and also solve some existing problems that might not have been considered yet. Furthermore, we had doubts about the school bus context, which we were initially preferring to focus on, as there might be issues of privacy etc. when children are being involved. Thus, we settled on the tour bus and tourist experience with an autonomous vehicle as our context since it seemed like an interesting option to explore and research down the track.</p>

                <p>As a group, we created a stakeholder map of the different types of users our design could affect. This gave us a clearer idea of who we should focus our testing on, and who our design caters to the most. With this in mind, we began figuring out what the best testing methods would be to implement, who our users were, and how we would recruit them. This also gave us more to consider in the testing and design process, as it showed us how far the reach of our project could potentially be.

                <p>Using the â€˜Design. Think. Make. Break.

We considered what would give us the most valuable insights in the timespan given. One of the key testing methods would be interviews, and thus we began drafting a list of interview questions regarding tour buses, the tourist experience and autonomous vehicles.

We each decided on 3-4 different testing methods to research the context and our users and planned how these tests would be carried out in the upcoming weeks.  </p>
                    
                    <p>By <b>week 3</b>, we began to focus on our individual testing methods and research. I had decided to conduct my research through <b>diary studies, direct experience/immersive observations and user interviews</b>. I began organising these tests by reaching out to potential participants and recruiting people to take part in them for the diary and interviews. Luckily, two people I knew were overseas on a trip in Thailand at the time, so I was able to contact them as ask them to write short diary entries over a week throughout their trip about different forms of transport theyâ€™d taken, the experience, thoughts, feelings and frustrations. I also began conducting interviews with some other uni students, friends or mutual friends that I knew who had past tourist experiences or been on tour buses before. I planned to find a variety of different users, from those who rarely travel to those who have had many tourist experiences.</p>

                  <p>Before conducting the observation, I did some research on the different hop on and hop off tour bus services in Sydney. The most popular seemed to be the Big Bus tour service, and it also had the most locations for different stops throughout the city that were accessible to me. I was able to get onto a bus towards the end of the day near Central station, and go for a short trip around the city to observe the experience from a first hand perspective. </p>

                <p>This gave me a really good idea of what it felt like to be an actual tourist on this experience. Furthermore, it let me spot out common problems or frustrations related to the experience while on the bus, which included the lack of entertainment, real time updates and information during the trip, inflexibility of the trip and personalised content. This seemed to really support the userâ€™s needs of wanting something unique and memorable, as the overall tour bus experience felt very systematic and commercialised. While it was a convenient way to get around the city, everyone ends the day having had the exact same experiences and nothing is specifically tailored to them. It felt like it was simply just a mode of transport, which doesnâ€™t aim to provide an interesting or exciting user journey while taking the bus.</p>
                  
                <p>I also conducted interviews and started receiving diary logs back from the other users that were being tested. I found that having a broad range of users with different perspectives in interviews gave me a really good idea of their needs and wants. Even though some users hadnâ€™t travelled a lot and other had been on many vacations, the most common theme was a desire for a unique experience that was personalised to them. When focusing on the forms of transport that users valued the most, convenience was a big consideration.</p>

                    <p>The best way of depicting and summarising all these findings were through the use of <b>personas</b>.

                <p>We initially approached the ideation with a more user experience centred approach, and this caused us to consider the user journey and experience as a whole in our ideas. While it allowed us more freedom and creativity, we steered a bit too far from the interface focus of the design brief. It also caused the autonomous vehicle to fall back in priority as we were considering the user needs over the brief.</p>

This allowed us to narrow down our focus into three main categories, which was autonomous planning, booking and alerts, as well as tourist pick up and drop offs. </p>
                    
                    <p>With these areas in mind, it became easier to ideate around the specific features in conjunction with the brief on autonomous vehicles, while also taking into account our tour bus context.

                    <p>After we refined these initial concepts into physical paper prototypes, it made it easy to to the first round of testing in <b>week 7</b>. We recruited users who had had tourist experiences and gave them a brief rundown on the purpose of our prototype. In order to get inside of the userâ€™s heads and follow their thought process throughout the testing sessions, we decided to use a combination of the <b>think aloud and cognitive walkthrough</b> methods.

                <p>After weâ€™d successfully developed a mockup of our prototypeâ€™s iteration, the next stage was to convert it into wireframes digitally on Sketch. In doing so, we kept the designâ€™s core principles of simplicity and directed flow in mind and transferred the screens as closely as we could to the sketched interface. Since we were still planning on testing this version of the wireframes, we didnâ€™t want to invest too much time into improving features that we wanted to change, since we wanted to figure out these insights from further user testing.

                <p>The first draft of our wireframes were put into a Pop prototype, which allowed us to quickly test it with randomly selected users at the university. These tests revealed that the depth of interaction was still quite shallow, since weâ€™d only implemented the main screens at this point. We didnâ€™t want to invest too much time at this stage into creating pop ups or additional minor screens, however the testing was helpful in revealing what features users commonly tried to interact with and what aspects led to confusion. This gave us a good idea of what extra pages, â€˜more infoâ€™ sections and clarification we needed in the final prototype and how to effectively add them to the interface.

                    <p>A key insight that stemmed from the initial tests of our wireframes also revealed that users lacked a â€˜mainâ€™ hub or central page to return to. After opening the app for the first time, the welcome page became redundant and users wanted something that gave them a better sense of their status within the experience or journey where they could quickly see an overview of key information. This gave us the idea to create a â€˜Dashboardâ€™ page common in many interfaces that provides a solution to these needs while also adding an extra layer of interaction to our user flow. By incorporating this extra page, it definitely improved the user experience drastically and seemed to bring the whole interface together and connect all the separate screens more effectively. Furthermore, it prompted the use of a footer to give users an extra sense of control by allowing easy access to the main three pages within the application.</p>

We still took the designs into testing with some users to get some feedback from their perspective, and we also did some more secondary research online for interfaces in a similar context to see whatâ€™s worked successfully for them. Users definitely had similar concerns as we did and didn't find the colour scheme very pleasing or easy to view.</p>
                  
                  <p>We found that many travel apps or websites tend to use a green/blue/yellow colour scheme, so we decided to move forward by creating another version using this palette. After doing so, we did some A/B testing with users to compare both versions and most people definitely preferred the green colour scheme a lot more. With the user testing to support our decision, we carried on reiterating the prototype with these colours.</p>

                <p>We ended up continuing to iterate our final design as each time we tested it, users would bring up new concerns. The original design had many arrow elements to give users a sense of flow and show them which way the app was directing them. While this worked effectively and had a positive response for the wireframes, it wasnâ€™t the case for a high fidelity design. Users tended to prefer icons or elements that are recognisable and similar to those that theyâ€™ve seen in other interfaces, thus we updated the design to reflect that.</p>
